	\maketitle
	In this project, I designed a database for storing experimental data of animal tests for testing the animals' neural cognition. This experiment is running by Texas A\&M Institute of Preclinical Studies. There are totally four tests on the experimental animals: spacial hole board test, T-maze test, go/no-go test, and balance beam test. The database will store the data of each trial in each test for different date and different animal. The application based on the database will help experimenter to select the animals based on the data and continue to the next step of experiment.
